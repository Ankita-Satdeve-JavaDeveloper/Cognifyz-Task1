# Project Overview: Temperature Converter
The Temperature Converter project is a simple Java application that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
<br>
The user is prompted to enter a temperature value and specify the unit of measurement (Celsius or Fahrenheit). 
<br>
Based on the input, the program performs the appropriate conversion and displays the converted temperature.
<br>

# Project Objective
<br>
The objective of the Temperature Converter project is to create a user-friendly tool that can easily convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
<br>
This project aims to strengthen basic programming skills such as handling user input, performing arithmetic operations, and implementing conditional logic in Java.
<br>

# Key Activities
<br>
✅User Input Handling:
<br>
Prompt the user to enter a temperature value.
<br>
Prompt the user to specify the unit of measurement (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
<br>
<br>

✅Temperature Conversion:
<br>
Convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit if the user selects Celsius.
<br>
Convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius if the user selects Fahrenheit.
<br>

✅Validation and Error Handling:
<br>
Validate the temperature value to ensure it is a numeric input.
<br>
Validate the unit input to ensure it is either 'c' or 'f'.
<br>
Handle invalid inputs gracefully by providing appropriate error messages.
<br>

✅Display Results:
<br>
Display the converted temperature to the user.
<br>

# Technologies Used
<br>
Java Programming Language: The core programming language used to implement the logic and functionality of the Temperature Converter.
<br>
Java Scanner Class: Used to handle user input from the console.
<br>
Conditional Statements (Switch): Used to determine the conversion logic based on user input.
<br>
Arithmetic Operations: Applied to perform the temperature conversions.
<br>

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
<br>
✅Class:
<br>
Your program defines a class named TemperatureConverter.
<br>
In Java, a class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.
<br>
Although your current implementation doesn't involve creating objects, the use of a class itself is a fundamental OOP concept.
<br>
✅Encapsulation:
<br>
Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class.
<br>
The TemperatureConverter class encapsulates the methods and logic required to convert temperatures.
<br>
Although you haven't used access modifiers (private, public, etc.), the concept is implicitly present since the logic is contained within a class.
<br>
✅Method:
<br>
The main method in your class is an example of a method, which is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. In this case, the main method serves as the entry point of your application.
<br>
✅Control Structures:
<br>
Conditional Statements: The switch statement is used to control the flow of the program based on the user's input (c or f), demonstrating the use of control structures in OOP.
<br>

# Java Concepts
<br>
✅Scanner Class:
<br>
The Scanner class from the java.util package is used to capture user input from the console.
<br>
This is an example of Java's standard library providing tools for input/output operations.
<br>
✅Arithmetic Operations:
<br>
Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are used to perform the temperature conversion formulas.
<br>
✅Data Types:
<br>
The program uses double for temperature values, which is a primitive data type in Java. It also uses String for capturing the unit of measurement.
<br>
✅String Manipulation:
<br>
The toLowerCase() method is used to handle the case-sensitivity of the user input. This is an example of Java’s string manipulation capabilities.
<br>
✅Switch Statement:
<br>
The switch statement is used to branch the code execution based on the user's input. It's a more structured alternative to multiple if-else statements.
<br>
✅Resource Management:
<br>
The use of sc.close() at the end of the program ensures that the Scanner resource is properly closed, preventing potential resource leaks.
<br>
This is an important concept in Java for managing system resources efficiently.
