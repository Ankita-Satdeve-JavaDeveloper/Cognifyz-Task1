# Project Overview: Temperature Converter
The Temperature Converter project is a simple Java application that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The user is prompted to enter a temperature value and specify the unit of measurement (Celsius or Fahrenheit). 
<br>
Based on the input, the program performs the appropriate conversion and displays the converted temperature.
<br>

# Project Objective
<br>
The objective of the Temperature Converter project is to create a user-friendly tool that can easily convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
<br>
This project aims to strengthen basic programming skills such as handling user input, performing arithmetic operations, and implementing conditional logic in Java.
<br>

# Key Activities
<br>
✅User Input Handling:
<br>
Prompt the user to enter a temperature value.
<br>
Prompt the user to specify the unit of measurement (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
<br>

✅Temperature Conversion:
<br>
Convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit if the user selects Celsius.
<br>
Convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius if the user selects Fahrenheit.
<br>

✅Validation and Error Handling:
<br>
Validate the temperature value to ensure it is a numeric input.
<br>
Validate the unit input to ensure it is either 'c' or 'f'.
<br>
Handle invalid inputs gracefully by providing appropriate error messages.
<br>

✅Display Results:
<br>
Display the converted temperature to the user.
<br>

# Technologies Used
<br>
Java Programming Language: The core programming language used to implement the logic and functionality of the Temperature Converter.
<br>
Java Scanner Class: Used to handle user input from the console.
<br>
Conditional Statements (Switch): Used to determine the conversion logic based on user input.
<br>
Arithmetic Operations: Applied to perform the temperature conversions.
